You absolutely can—and should—leverage one of Chainlink’s starter kits to bootstrap v0. Using a proven template will save you hours wiring up Hardhat, Ethers, and Data Feeds so you can focus on your vault logic and UI. Here’s how to get going in minutes:

---  
## 1. Pick Your Starter Kit  
Chainlink maintains two main templates:  
• Hardhat Starter Kit → https://github.com/smartcontractkit/hardhat-starter-kit  
• Foundry Starter Kit → https://github.com/smartcontractkit/foundry-starter-kit  

For v0 we’ll use the **Hardhat Starter Kit** (it comes pre-wired with Chainlink price feeds, Ethers.js, and contract tests).

---  
## 2. Quickstart with Hardhat Starter Kit  

1) Clone the repo  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/smartcontractkit/hardhat-starter-kit.git defi-copilot  
cd defi-copilot
```

2) Install dependencies  
```bash
npm install
```

3) Create your environment file  
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# now edit .env, fill in:
# ALCHEMY_API_KEY_GOERLI
# PRIVATE_KEY
```

4) Take a look at `contracts/PriceConsumerV3.sol`—it already shows you how to read a Chainlink Data Feed on Goerli. For v0 you can:
   • Rename it (e.g. `StrategyManager.sol`)  
   • Add your deposit/withdraw vault (`CoPilotVault.sol`) alongside it  

5) Run the existing tests to confirm everything’s wired up  
```bash
npx hardhat test
```

6) Configure your deploy script in `scripts/deploy.js`  
   • Deploy `CoPilotVault.sol`  
   • Deploy your renamed `StrategyManager.sol` with the Goerli ETH/USD feed address  

7) Deploy to Goerli  
```bash
npx hardhat run --network goerli scripts/deploy.js
```

---  
## 3. Hook Up Your Vault & UI

1) Copy the starter kit’s `artifacts/contracts/PriceConsumerV3.sol/PriceConsumerV3.json` ABI into your UI folder (or simply import it).  
2) Spin up the UI (the kit includes a minimal Next.js app in `frontend/`)  
   ```bash
   cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev
   ```  
3) In that UI, swap out the “PriceConsumer” contract address & ABI for your `StrategyManager` and `CoPilotVault` contracts—then wire up deposit/withdraw calls exactly as you would in a fresh Next.js app.

---  
## 4. Why Use the Starter Kit  

• Instant Chainlink integration (price feeds, mocks, config)  
• Sample tests that you can extend for your vault logic  
• Pre-configured Hardhat, Ethers, and TypeChain  
• Ship a polished demo faster—so you can jump to v1 (Automation + CCIP) with time to spare  

---  
## 5. Next Steps for v0  

1. Rename `PriceConsumerV3.sol` → `StrategyManager.sol` and add your `getLatestPrice()` logic.  
2. Drop in `CoPilotVault.sol` next to it.  
3. Update `scripts/deploy.js` to deploy both contracts.  
4. Run `npx hardhat node` locally + `npx hardhat run` against it to sanity-check.  
5. Point the `frontend/` app at your new contracts and demo deposit/withdraw + live price.

By starting with Chainlink’s Hardhat Starter Kit, you’ll have a working v0 in under half a day—and you’ll spend your hackathon time on the novel parts (Automation, CCIP, AI) instead of boilerplate setup. Let’s do it! 🚀
